    <h2>J.R. Carpenterâ€™s A Handmade Web</h2>
<p>When reading A Handmade Web, I really liked how Carpenter talked about the web as a kind of handmade craft; something that was personal and imperfect. It is not polished or looks like any corporate sites we see today. This makes me think about how the websites that I end up visiting are all so similar, like they are made by machines and not people. I also liked how she connected the web to the body, and the idea of using/making websites takes physical and mental work to make. It made me think about how hard it can be to scroll through large amounts of code, as it is manual labor. This text made me want to explore more old-school handmade web designs and to try some of my own. </p>
